# Arrays

- Reverse an array in place
- Find missing number in an array of a range - diff of expected sum - actual sum
- Find duplicate number on an integer array - same as above
- check if an array contains a number - linear/binary search. Binary search on sorted
- find the largest and smallest of an array - o(n) iterate and find out
- except one element, every entry in array is repeated twice - XOR all elements gives the value
- kth smallest/largest element in an array - min/max heap

- find all pairs on integer array whose sum is equal to a given number
- find repeated numbers in an array - similar to finding repeated chars in string
- remove duplicates from array
- sort an array in place using Quick Sort
- intersection of two sorted arrays
- common elements in three sorted arrays
- first repeating element in an array of integers
- first repeating element in an array of integers with lowest index
